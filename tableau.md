Your worksheet is where you will build your visualization and it will look like below. You can drag your tables to where you want them to be. Filters and marks are very helpful to be used.

You can combine multiple worksheets into your dashboard.

### Bins
Bins can be created for numeric values and can be used to group.

Tableau will give you a recommended size for the bin but you can change it. I changed the bin size to 5.

Then you can add the new field to your sheet.

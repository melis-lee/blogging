Power BI can be used for data visualization.

First we need to import our data. In this case we are importing an Excel sheet. You have the option to transform the data first, such as renaming column names, removing rows, etc.

Now you can create visualizations. You can choose different ones under "visualization". "Data" is where you select the columns that you want to use for your visualization.

Power query allows you to make changes to your data before loading it in Power BI. You can do all the things you can do in Excel too like removing rows, updating column types, updating names, and filtering.

You can create relationships between different tables in Power BI. You can do that in the model tab. Power BI often creates relationships automatically but you are able to change those if you want.

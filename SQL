Refreshing on SQL using the Data Analyst Bootcamp by Alex the Analyst on Youtube

--- Basic SQL ---
  SELECT statement: Top, Distinct, Count, As, Max, Min, Avg
  FROM statement: tell SQL which table to pull the data from
  WHERE statement: =, <>, <, >, <=, >=, And, Or, Like, Null, Not Null, In
    you can use the wildcard '%' when using Like
  GROUP BY statement
  ORDER BY statement

--- Intermediate SQL ---
  Inner join 2 tables = everything in common between both tables
    SELECT *
    FROM table1
    Inner Join table2
    ON table1.id = table2.id

  Full Outer Join = show everything from both tables regardless whether there is a match

  Left Outer Join = take everything from the first table and everything that matches with it from the second table but if anything is only in the second table, it is not included

  Righter Outer Join = take everything from the second table and everything that matches with it from the first table but if anything is only in the first table, it is not included

  Union "stacks" two tables while taking out any duplicates, you need the data to be the same for it to work
    SELECT *
    FROM table1
    UNION
    SELECT *
    FROM table2

  Union all shows all the results and doesn't remove any duplicates

  CASE statement: is an if else statement
    SELECT *
    CASE
      WHEN variable " " THEN " "
      ELSE " "
    END AS " "
    FROM table

  HAVING clause: used when WHERE can't be used with aggregate functions
    SELECT COUNT(jobTitle)
    FROM table1
    GROUP BY jobTitle
    HAVING COUNT(jobTitle) > 1

  UPDATE: updates value in your table
    UPDATE table1  
    SET " "
    WHERE " "

  DELETE: removes entire row from your table
    DELETE FROM table1
    WHERE " "

  Aliasing: temporarily changes column name in your table
    SELECT columnName as Name
    FROM table1

    SELECT columnA + " " + columnB AS columnC
    FROM table1

  Partition by: isolates one specific column you want to aggregate
    SELECT FirstName, LastName, Gender, Salary, 
      COUNT(Gender) OVER (PARTITION BY Gender) as TotalGender

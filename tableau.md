Your worksheet is where you will build your visualization and it will look like below. You can drag your tables to where you want them to be. Filters and marks are very helpful to be used.

You can combine multiple worksheets into your dashboard.

### Bins
Bins can be created for numeric values and can be used to group.

Tableau will give you a recommended size for the bin but you can change it. I changed the bin size to 5.

Then you can add the new field to your sheet.

### Calculated Fields
Calculated field can be created as below and in this specific example it impacts the y-axis.

You could drag this newly created field to your tables on the left to save it.

Instead of creating this quick calculated field, you can also create one.

It works a bit like Excel and you can use all kind of calculations like additions, multiplications, subtractions, etc.
